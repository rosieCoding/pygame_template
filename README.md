# pygame_template

A pygame template I created watching the "KidsCanCode" tutorial
series on Youtube by Chris Bradfield.

A basic python 3 pygame "game" with a player, enemy, play grid, movement locked
to grid, key bindings, and basic collision detection. Heavily commented for a
friend which basically outlines the program.
