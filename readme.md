## PYTHON 3 PYGAME GAME TEMPLATE
###### #pygame_template

A pygame template I created watching the [**KidsCanCode**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO8rTszcW4s) tutorial
series on Youtube by _**Chris Bradfield**_.

A basic python 3 pygame "game" with a player, enemy, play grid, movement locked
to grid, key bindings, and basic collision detection. Heavily commented for a
friend which basically outlines the program.
